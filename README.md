# BloomLife — Therapist Website Homepage

BloomLife is a thoughtfully designed homepage for a fictional therapy practice.  
The project focuses on calm, accessible design paired with intentional motion to create a sense of safety, clarity, and professionalism.

The goal of this homepage is to demonstrate how layout, typography, and subtle animations can work together to support emotionally sensitive content without overwhelming the user.

## ✨ Design & Experience Goals

- Create a **calm, grounded visual language** suitable for a therapy practice
- Use **motion intentionally**, only where it adds clarity or emotional pacing
- Avoid flashy or distracting animations
- Maintain strong **accessibility and performance** standards
- Ensure the interface feels supportive, not sales-driven

---

## 🧠 Motion & Interaction Philosophy

Animations in this project follow a clear hierarchy:

- **Hero & Section Entrances**  
  Soft fade and micro-translations guide attention without distraction.

- **Accordion Interactions (FAQ & Background)**  
  Smooth expanding/collapsing motion improves readability and makes state changes clear.

- **Hover States**  
  Lightweight CSS-based interactions are used for performance and responsiveness.

- **Footer**  
  Minimal motion to signal visual closure and stability.

All animations are:
- Scroll-based
- Run once
- Free of looping or attention-grabbing effects
